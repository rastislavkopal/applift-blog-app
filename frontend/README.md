# Getting Started with Create React App

Uses:
 - React Router
 - Ant Design
 - Recoil for state management 

## Available Scripts

Leave the default env values or change as needed:

### `cp .env.example .env`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `yarn run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

### Deployment

### `yarn run build` fails to minify
